Add the secret cable club, probably in cerulean.
review all partaining text regarding the cable to indicate the pokecenters are outdated.

Review the position of trainers and sight in routes as well.

list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code, in order of most interesting of getting done


try to make the AIMoveChoiceModification2 actually proc on turn 1 instead of turn 2. If so, review move_choices.asm to sprinke some 2s on more trainer classes


Make the make output the rom as carminered instead of pokered
^^pretty sure this has to do with makefile


Minor aesthetic changes to other routes and dungeons


Below are the things on the todo list that I deem less interesting to focus on, in order of most relevant to least
__________________________________________________________________________

try to implement the code that makes a block appear in seafoam islands when the boulders are set into place. 
until then I'll just workaround it with dialogue

try to implement chatot4444's method for doing rock tomb to try to do my mist move properly. Haze will have to wait for the clean smog effect, but if its replicable I might be able to so something cool with it too.
^^right now is balanced within the current chance%, but if I do this I could make easily haze and mist do their current effects but instead the guaranteed ones. For Sand attack and kinesis, I think they're better with just the low chance, since their PP/power is balanced around their procs
