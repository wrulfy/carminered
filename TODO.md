test the dialogues
verify that the wandering trainers doesnt do the thing anymore (the hiker had a vision of 3 that was problematic and changed to 2)

see if I can get the out of battle dialogue to the gym leaders after the rematch, if not, keep all the text in the victory.

maybe try to implement again the rival victory speeches, but only if a way to make it so it only affects the rival is disclosed. the current tutorial screws up every other trainer.

maybe implement again the caught icon on wild battles if a way to make it only show on wilds and not on trainer, is found

Make the code that assigns palettes to maps do it in a table fashion way instead of cities go by palette order then routes go by route palette then exceptions, so I can tweak them to my hearts content much more easily
