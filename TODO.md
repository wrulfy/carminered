list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code

figure how to enable signed on \4 on engine\pokemon\experience.asm so I can fully use the new special experience group. Until then I have a workable version of it, not much change needed


(check how it plays with the nest icon)



try to implement chatot4444's method for doing rock tomb to try to do my mist move properly. Haze will have to wait for the clean smog effect, but if its replicable I might be able to so something cool with it too. 

check if I need to reposition the constants of the magikarp and the rods to their corresponding maps
edit maps:

safari zone, to reflect evil plans
Giovanni's gym so I can do the evil plan

minor aesthetic changes to other routes

Add some trainer to trainer-barren routes, specially seafoam

add the new map to catch mew

rebalance trainers so theyre not as weak


move the script that reset the switches of the mansion towards the route 10 instead
move the script that makes the fossils alive to celadon dept store

text extensively that the victory road 2f and the pokemon mansion 3f works fine after moving moltres
check that I don't have to move the check events from routes regarding moltres
