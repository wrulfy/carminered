see if I can get the out of battle dialogue to the gym leaders after the rematch, if not, keep all the text in the victory.
>not likely gonna happen, also I'm content with the dialogues so far, making more new dialogues is pain

maybe try to implement again the rival victory speeches, but only if a way to make it so it only affects the rival is disclosed. the current tutorial screws up every other trainer.
>could be cool but unless it can be made for ONLY the rival. if I have to set up for the rest then it wont. I concede having to revisit the trainers that have the script half baked that makes it point out to the losing quote, but no more.


maybe implement again the caught icon on wild battles if a way to make it only show on wilds and not on trainer, is found
>the caught icon is cool and all, but I really dont like it popping in trainer battles. If it doesn't work like in gen 2 I'm not gonna consider it. and too many QoL will make the game feel less like gen1

Make the code that assigns palettes to maps do it in a table fashion way instead of cities go by palette order then routes go by route palette then exceptions, so I can tweak them to my hearts content much more easily
>far beyond my understanding but I'm pretty sure it should be plausible to have a file with a list of palettes assigned for each map just like there's one for pokemon.
