list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code

figure how to enable signed on \4 on engine\pokemon\experience.asm so I can fully use the new special experience group. Until then I have a workable version of it, not much change needed

try to implement chatot4444's method for doing rock tomb to try to do my mist move properly. Haze will have to wait for the clean smog effect, but if its replicable I might be able to so something cool with it too. 

Figure out how to make the battle items use a move effect rather than a battle flag bit

Make the make output the rom as carminered instead of pokered

Minor aesthetic changes to other routes

Add some trainer to trainer-barren routes, specially seafoam

finish rebalance trainers so theyre not as weak
finish adding the special moves to trainers

text extensively that the victory road 2f works fine after moving moltres
check that I don't have to move the check events from routes regarding moltres

tweak the great/ultra balls to see the results of alteratios in the formula for a better rebalance

see if its possible to alter the way exp.all works, to see if I can make it not halve XP before sharing, so it works like a gen+ exp share. also maybe make it a key item so is not soldable but still storable


check if the chief trainers move after the tower fight, if they dont I can turn them into a different sprite, if so, reprupose the balding sprite
maybe reuse another sprite that's very less used
