list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code

figure how to enable signed on \4 on engine\pokemon\experience.asm so I can fully use the new special experience group. Until then I have a workable version of it, not much change needed

reorganize the town_map_order.asm to reflect better the order of things

tweak a bit the town map with tileset studio so it loos more 
try to use the 3 unused tiles for the digglet cave or the out-of route dungeons (check how it plays with the nest icon)

rename the power plant so is what it will be
move the "sea cottage" to signal the evil plan

try to implement chatot4444's method for doing rock tomb to try to do my mist move properly. Haze will have to wait for the clean smog effect, but if its replicable I might be able to so something cool with it too. 

finish repositioning the gurus

edit maps:

safari zone, to reflect evil plans
Giovanni's gym so I can do the evil plan

minor aesthetic changes to other routes

Add some trainer to trainer-barren routes, specially seafoam

add the new map to catch mew

rebalance trainers so theyre not as weak
