list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code

figure how to enable signed on \4 on engine\pokemon\experience.asm so I can fully use the new special experience group. Until then I have a workable version of it, not much change needed

try to implement chatot4444's method for doing rock tomb to try to do my mist move properly. Haze will have to wait for the clean smog effect, but if its replicable I might be able to so something cool with it too. 

check if I need to reposition the constants of the magikarp and the rods to their corresponding maps

Giovanni's gym so I can do the evil plan

minor aesthetic changes to other routes

Add some trainer to trainer-barren routes, specially seafoam


rebalance trainers so theyre not as weak
finish adding the special moves to trainers

text extensively that the victory road 2f works fine after moving moltres
check that I don't have to move the check events from routes regarding moltres

check how adding a new overworld map works, specially since I think they have to be all together
add a new entrance to the mew map there, since no one important made code to implement flash in other overworld maps
