list of very specific code-related things to keep for last in case I eventually learn asm or to commission someone to code

figure how to enable signed on \4 on engine\pokemon\experience.asm so I can fully use the new special experience group

re-enable the 30% freeze chance of the move effect 23 for evil pruposes
try to make the unused effect of dropping accurary a 10% of the time to a 30% unless it breaks everything around it, in case I want to rebalance sand attack
