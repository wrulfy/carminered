-check HandleExplodingAnimation and PlayMoveAnimation over core.asm to find where it calls for megapunch after succesfully perfoming an explosion to see if I can get fancy with it

Make the make output the rom as carminered instead of pokered

find again where the distiction between dig and fly was in the code and see if this time I can assign withdraw with charge_effect but still behave like the immunity of dig
or alternatively make so while it uses the fly_effect, it lets me assign a different animation from the fly turn 1.

Make the code that assigns palettes to maps do in a table fashion way instead of cities go by palette order then routes go by route palette then exceptions, so I can tweak them to my hearts content much more easily
