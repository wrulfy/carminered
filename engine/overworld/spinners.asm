SpinnerPlayerFacingDirections:
; This isn't the order of the facing directions.  Rather, it's a list of
; the facing directions that come next. For example, when the player is
; facing down (00), the next facing direction is left (08).
	db $08 ; down -> left
	db $0C ; up -> right
	db $04 ; left -> up
	db $00 ; right -> down

; these tiles are the animation for the tiles that push the player in dungeons like Rocket HQ
